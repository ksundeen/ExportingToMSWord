This script uses the python-docx module to create, access, and update existing Microsoft Word documents for documenting metadata of hundreds of Esri feature classes contained within an enterprise SDE geodatabase environment.. Specifically, It sets your development space for editing in a 64-bit OS and sets your python variables (since the python-docx module is 64-bit). Using the docx module, you access your SDE GIS database to grab attributes within each feature class within each feature dataset to print out a nice list of your datasets, feature classes, and attributes for each feature classes.
